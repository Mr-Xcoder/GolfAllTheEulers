# Golf All The Eulers!

A project for golfing every Project Euler problem.

## Rules

- No hardcoding of the answer. Use your common sense.
- Output your answer to STDOUT.
- All answers must work "out-of-the-box" - i.e. all files have to be complete by itself, without any changes to the file.
- This means that it should work with the standard compiler for the language (aka gcc, g++, python) by **itself**, without any third-party add-ons..

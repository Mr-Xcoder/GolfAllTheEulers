# Golf All The Eulers!

A project for golfing every Project Euler problem.

## Rules

- No hardcoding of the answer. Use your common sense.
- Output your answer to STDOUT.
- By default, headers like `#include <iostream>` are written, but do not include self-written or non-standard headers like `#include <answer_to_0001.h>`.
